## Creating a responsive portfolio

For this assignment, we first started by creating and index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html file. Each file respresenting the main three tabs of the responsive portfolio website: 'About Me/Home', 'Contact', and 'Portfolio'.

## index.html

The index.html file contains the code for the About Me/home page. This page, as well as 'Contact' and 'Portfolio' contain a nav bar and a sticky footer. Code for which was optained from Bootstrap. We also had to link to the Bootstrap documentation in every page. In 'About me', I decided to include a picture of my friends in I, along with a brief overview of myself.

## conact.html

The contact page is mostly a user input page. Here, the user can input their name, email address, and a message. However, for our purposes these messages do not need to actually be sent to my email.

## Portfolio.html

The portfolio page includes three of my favorite pictures that were on my computer. I also feel these pictures sum up my personality/activities pretty well. I did have trouble uploading the pictures I wanted, as I could not get my iCloud to sinc my pictures from my phone to my computer. Therefore, I was restricted to only the pictures on my computer, which were quite limited. These are set up as three cards, via bootstrap. I also included a brief description of the photos and where they were taken.

## style2.css

Although I used predominantly bootstrap, I did make this .css page to make minor edits to my website. Mostly for editing pictures, colors, and text.
